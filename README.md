# tipCalculator
Program utilizing nested for loops to determine different tip amounts for varying dollar values

How it Works:

This program is a tip calculator for a restuarant. It uses nested loops to compute the 15%, 20% and 25% tip amounts for ten different dinner prices.

The user enters the base price of thier meal (at least $10) and the program calculates the 15%, 20%, and 25% tip amounts based on the given dinner price plus the next nine dinner prices (incremented by $10 each time) and thier respecitve tip amounts in a tabular view.
